# Content guidelines

Tabs can be used to reflect a categorisation of information, where one category can be viewed at the same time.

Tabs are not optimal for browsing or exploring information. For that purpose better choose one of the alternatives.

Tabs should only be used when the user is likely to know or predict the names/content of the tabs (like in frequently used functions or admin environments)
