### Anatomy

The tabs anatomy is researched and described in detail here: https://deploy-preview-350--open-ui.netlify.app/components/tabs.research.parts
This tabs setup follows the rough categorisation of elements:
- TabSet: The element containing the underlying TabList and TabPanels
- TabList: A list of TabLabel elements
- TabLabel: The element most recognisable as the "tab item" itself. Contains a label describing a corresponding TabPanel.
- TabPanel: Contains the content corresponding to the TabLabel.
